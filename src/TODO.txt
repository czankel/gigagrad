- [DONE] Refactor Graph representation. We probably want indices into std::vector of
  GraphNode instead of references to GraphNode that lives in std::deque.
- Reorganize code, create public API
// - Remove all Int insns in codegen, switch it to a "ComputeIndexInsn"
- Add support for simplifying address calculations
- [DONE] Add support for strides
- Add support for more datatypes
- Start implementing optimizations like tiling
- Add more backends
- More input validation
- Handle cycles (currently this case is just ignored and probably causes an infinite recursion)

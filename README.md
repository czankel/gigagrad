# Gigagrad
A small deep learning library that goes gigafast.

# Building
This project uses the [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html) build system. You can 
install it with `pip3` with `pip3 install meson`. Next, building Gigagrad is as simple as
```
    meson setup build
    cd build
    meson compile
    
```
From there, you can run tests such as `./gigagrad-test`.
